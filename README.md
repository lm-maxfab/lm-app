# LM App.

The [master branch](https://github.com/lm-maxfab/lm-app/tree/master/src "master branch") contains an empty project with the latest versin of the app wrapper. Every longform or snippet created from this repo has it's own branch named after this template :

`[PROJECT-NB]-[YYMM]-[PROJECT-NAME]`.
